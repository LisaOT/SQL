#  I created this table and entered the data as a simulated clothing store database.

CREATE TABLE tops (id Integer primary key, name TEXT, price integer, color text, fabric text, quantity integer);

INSERT INTO tops VALUES (1, "v-neck", 10, "red", "wool", 5);
INSERT INTO tops VALUES (2, "turtleneck", 12, "blue", "wool", 6);
INSERT INTO tops VALUES (3, "boatneck", 14, "pink", "silk", 6);
INSERT INTO tops VALUES (4, "v-neck", 15, "black", "rayon", 8);
INSERT INTO tops VALUES (5, "cowl neck", 13, "beige", "cotton", 7);
INSERT INTO tops VALUES (6, "cardigan", 15, "red", "polyester", 5);
INSERT INTO tops VALUES (7, "turtleneck", 16, "gray", "wool", 4);
INSERT INTO tops VALUES (8, "tunic", 10, "black", "cotton", 7);
INSERT INTO tops VALUES (9, "pullover", 12, "pink", "rayon", 6);
INSERT INTO tops VALUES (10, "boatneck", 16, "blue", "polyester", 8);
INSERT INTO tops VALUES (11, "tunic", 13, "gray", "cotton", 9);
INSERT INTO tops VALUES (12, "cardigan", 14, "orange", "wool", 5);
INSERT INTO tops VALUES (13, "pullover", 10, "yellow", "cotton", 7);
INSERT INTO tops VALUES (14, "button_down", 12, "white", "polyester blend", 7);
INSERT INTO tops VALUES (15, "tunic", 14, "purple", "wool", 5);

## Below is the SQL I wrote to analyze the data from the table:

#1 Display all of the data about the clothing and order the inventory by price.

SELECT *
FROM tops 
ORDER BY price asc;

#2 Display the name, price, and fabric of the tops and categorize the items by regular price, sale price, and clearance price.

SELECT name, price, fabric,
CASE 
WHEN price >=14 THEN 'Regular Price'
WHEN price >=12 THEN 'Sale Price'
ELSE 'Clearance'
END AS Current_Promotion
FROM tops
ORDER BY price desc;

#3 Display information about these specific tops (v-neck, pullover, tunic, and turtleneck) and display them alphabetically by name.

SELECT name, fabric, price 
FROM tops
WHERE name 
IN ('v-neck', 'pullover', 'tunic', 'turtleneck')
ORDER BY name;

#4 Which tops have 5 or more in stock and are priced above $14?

SELECT name, price, quantity, fabric 
FROM tops
WHERE quantity >=5
AND price >14;

#5 What is the total inventory of tops in the store?

SELECT SUM(QUANTITY) as total_inventory
FROM TOPS;

#6 Which tops have 7 or more in inventory?

SELECT quantity, color, name
FROM TOPS 
WHERE QUANTITY >= 7 
ORDER BY QUANTITY ASC;

#7 Which tops are in stock in blue, and what are the prices?

SELECT name, color, price
FROM tops
WHERE color='blue';

#8 What is the average price of each top characterized by fabric?

SELECT avg(price) as average_price, fabric
FROM tops
GROUP BY fabric
HAVING avg(price) >=13;

#9 How many different styles of tops are in stock in the store?

SELECT COUNT(distinct name) as total_styles
FROM tops;

#10 Which top is the most expensive, and what is the fabric content?

SELECT name, fabric, max(price)
FROM tops;

#11 Which top is the least expensive, and what is the fabric content?

SELECT name, fabric, min(price)
FROM tops;
