# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table:

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.

SELECT*FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata LIMIT 1;

#1 What is the average danceability by artist and track?

SELECT artist_name, track_name,AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name;

#2 Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

#3 What artist released the longest song?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, max(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#4 What is the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity, avg(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

#5 What artist released the song with the highest energy?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, max(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY energy desc
LIMIT 1;

#6 What 10 songs have the lowest speechiness?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, min(speechiness)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY speechiness
LIMIT 10;

#7 What 10 songs have the highest speechiness?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, max(speechiness)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY speechiness desc
Limit 10;

#8 What is the average instrumentalness of the songs with a popularity of 90 and above?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity, avg(instrumentalness)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING popularity >=90
ORDER BY popularity desc;

#9 What are the lengths of the 10 most popular songs?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity >=90
ORDER BY popularity desc
Limit 10;

#10 What is the popularity of the loudest song?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity, Max(loudness)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY loudness desc
LIMIT 1;
